A control that displays its children in a vertical array.

To cause a child control to expand and fill the available vertical space set its `expand` property.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

### Infinite scroll list

The following example demonstrates adding of list items on-the-fly, as user scroll to the bottom, creating the illusion of infinite list:

```python reference
https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/example-polishing/python/controls/layout/column/column-infinite-list.py
```

### Scrolling column programmatically

The following example demonstrates various `scroll_to()` options as well as defines a custom scrollbar theme:

```python reference
https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/example-polishing/python/controls/layout/column/column-scroll-misc.py
```

## Properties

### `alignment`

How the child Controls should be placed vertically.

Value is of type [`MainAxisAlignment`](/docs/reference/types/mainaxisalignment).

### `auto_scroll`

`True` if scrollbar should automatically move its position to the end when children updated. Must be `False` for `scroll_to()` method to work.

### `controls`

A list of Controls to display inside the Column.

### `horizontal_alignment`

How the child Controls should be placed horizontally.

Value is of type [`CrossAxisAlignment`](/docs/reference/types/crossaxisalignment) and defaults
to `CrossAxisAlignment.START`.

### `on_scroll_interval`

Throttling in milliseconds for `on_scroll` event. Default is `10`.

### `rtl`

`True` to set text direction to right-to-left. Default is `False`.

### `run_spacing`

Spacing between runs when `wrap=True`. Default value is 10.

### `scroll`

Enables a vertical scrolling for the Column to prevent its content overflow.

Value is of type [`ScrollMode`](/docs/reference/types/scrollmode) and defaults to `ScrollMode.None`.

### `spacing`

Spacing between controls in a Column. Default value is 10 virtual pixels. Spacing is applied only when `alignment` is set to `start`, `end` or `center`.

### `tight`

Specifies how much space should be occupied vertically.

Defaults to `False` - allocate all space to children.

### `wrap`

When set to `True` the Column will put child controls into additional columns (runs) if they don't fit a single column.

## Methods

### `scroll_to(offset, delta, key, duration, curve)`

Moves scroll position to either absolute `offset`, relative `delta` or jump to the control with specified `key`.

`offset` is an absolute value between minimum and maximum extents of a scrollable control, for example:

```python
products.scroll_to(offset=100, duration=1000)
```

`offset` could be a negative to scroll from the end of a scrollable. For example, to scroll to the very end:

```python
products.scroll_to(offset=-1, duration=1000)
```

`delta` allows moving scroll relatively to the current position. Use positive `delta` to scroll forward and negative `delta` to scroll backward. For example, to move scroll on 50 pixels forward:

```python
products.scroll_to(delta=50)
```

`key` allows moving scroll position to a control with specified `key`. Most of Flet controls have `key` property which is translated to Flutter as "global key". `key` must be unique for the entire page/view. For example:

```python
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    cl = ft.Column(
        spacing=10,
        height=200,
        width=200,
        scroll=ft.ScrollMode.ALWAYS,
    )
    for i in range(0, 50):
        cl.controls.append(ft.Text(f"Text line {i}", key=str(i)))

    def scroll_to_key(e):
        cl.scroll_to(key="20", duration=1000)

    page.add(
        ft.Container(cl, border=ft.border.all(1)),
        ft.ElevatedButton("Scroll to key '20'", on_click=scroll_to_key),
    )

ft.app(main)
```

:::note
`scroll_to()` method won't work with `ListView` and `GridView` controls building their items dynamically.
:::

`duration` is scrolling animation duration in milliseconds. Defaults to `0` - no animation.

`curve` configures animation curve. Property value is [`AnimationCurve`](/docs/reference/types/animationcurve) enum.
Defaults to `AnimationCurve.EASE`.

## Events

### `on_scroll`

Fires when scroll position is changed by a user.

Event handler argument is an instance of [`OnScrollEvent`](/docs/reference/types/onscrollevent) class.

## Expanding children

When a child Control is placed into a Column you can "expand" it to fill the available space. Every Control has `expand` property that can have either a boolean value (`True` - expand control to fill all available space) or an integer - an "expand factor" specifying how to divide a free space with other expanded child controls. For example, this code creates a column with a Container taking all available space and a Text control at the bottom serving as a status bar:

```python
r = ft.Column([
  ft.Container(expand=True, content=ft.Text("Here is search results")),
  ft.Text("Records found: 10")
])
```

The following example with numeric expand factors creates a Column with 3 containers in it and having heights of `20% (1/5)`, `60% (3/5)` and `20% (1/5)` respectively:

```python
r = ft.Column([
  ft.Container(expand=1, content=ft.Text("Header")),
  ft.Container(expand=3, content=ft.Text("Body")),
  ft.Container(expand=1, content=ft.Text("Footer"))
])
```

In general, the resulting height of a child in percents is calculated as `expand / sum(all expands) * 100%`.

If you need to give the child Control of the Column the flexibility to expand to fill the available space vertically but not require it to fill the available space, set its `expand_loose` property to `True`.
