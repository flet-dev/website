A Material-style time picker dialog.

It is added to [`page.overlay`](page#overlay) and called using its [`pick_time()`](timepicker#pick_time) method.

Depending on the [`time_picker_entry_mode`](timepicker#time_picker_entry_mode), it will show either a Dial or an Input (hour and minute text fields) for picking a time.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
