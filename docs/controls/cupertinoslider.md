An macOS style slider. It provides a visual indication of adjustable content, as well as the current setting in the total range of content.

Use a slider when you want people to set defined values (such as volume or brightness), or when people would benefit from instant feedback on the effect of setting changes.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
