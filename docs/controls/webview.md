## Examples

A simple implementation that loads the [flet.dev](https://flet.dev) website:

```python
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    wv = ft.WebView(
        url="https://flet.dev",
        on_page_started=lambda _: print("Page started"),
        on_page_ended=lambda _: print("Page ended"),
        on_web_resource_error=lambda e: print("Page error:", e.data),
        expand=True,
    )
    page.add(wv)

ft.app(main)
```
