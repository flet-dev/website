title: Stack
sidebar_label: Stack
---

A control that positions its children on top of each other.

This control is useful if you want to overlap several children in a simple way, for example having some text and an image, overlaid with a gradient and a button attached to the bottom.

Stack is also useful if you want to implement [implicit animations](/docs/cookbook/animations) that require knowing absolute position of a target value.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
