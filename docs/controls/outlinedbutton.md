Outlined buttons are medium-emphasis buttons. They contain actions that are important, but arenâ€™t the primary action in an app.
Outlined buttons pair well with filled buttons to indicate an alternative, secondary action. See [Material 3 buttons](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/overview) for more info.
