## Text

`Text` control is used to output textual data. Its main properties are `value` and `size`, but it also has a number of formatting properties to control its appearence. For example:

```python
t = Text(
    value="This is a Text control sample",
    size=30,
    color="white",
    bgcolor="pink",
    weight="bold",
    italic=True,
)
page.add(t)
```
