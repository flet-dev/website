## Implicit animations

With implicit animations, you can animate a control property by setting a target value; whenever that target value changes, the control animates the property from the old value to the new one. Animation produces interpolated values between the old and the new value over the given *duration*. By default, the animation is *linearly* increasing the animation value, however, a *curve* can be applied to the animation which changes the value according to the provided curve. For example, `easeOutCubic` curve increases the animation value quickly at the beginning of the animation and then slows down until the target value is reached:
