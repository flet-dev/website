### Manifest

You can change PWA's name, description, colors and other information in `manifest.json` that must be put in the root of [assets directory](/docs/guides/python/deploying-web-app/customizing-web-app).

Here are the links to the most common manifest items that you'd like to customize:

* [`name`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/name) - the name of the web application as it is usually displayed to the user.
* [`short_name`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/short_name) - the name of the web application displayed to the user if there is not enough space to display `name`.
* [`description`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/description) - explains what the application does.
* [`theme_color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/theme_color) - defines the default theme color for the application.
* [`background_color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/background_color) - defines a placeholder background color for the application page to display before its stylesheet is loaded.

### Icons

Custom icons are placed in `icons` directory in the root of assets directory:

* `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png` - app icons displayed in Windows taskbar.
* `icon-maskable-192.png`, `icon-maskable-512.png` - app icons displayed in Android.
* `apple-touch-icon-192.png` - app icon displayed in iOS.
