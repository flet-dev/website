Flet app can be deployed as a "standalone" web app which means both your Python app and Flet web server are deployed together as a bundle.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
