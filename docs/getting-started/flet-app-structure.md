A very minimal Flet app has the following structure:

```python
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    # add/update controls on Page
    pass

ft.app(target=main)
```

<img src="/img/docs/getting-started/basic-app-structure.png" className="screenshot-50" />

A typical Flet program ends with a call to `flet.app()` where the app starts waiting for new user sessions. Function `main()` is an entry point in a Flet application. It's being called on a new thread for every user session with a `Page` instance passed into it. When running Flet app in the browser a new user session is started for every opened tab or page. When running as a desktop app there is only one session created.

`Page` is like a "canvas" specific to a user, a visual state of a user session. To build an application UI you add and remove controls to a page, update their properties. Code sample above will be displaying just a blank page to every user.

By default, Flet app starts in a native OS window, which is very handy for developing. However, you can open it in a new browser window by modifying a call to `flet.app` as following:

```python
ft.app(target=main, view=ft.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)
```

:::info
Internally, every Flet app is a web app and even if it's opened in a native OS window a built-in web server is still started on a background. Flet web server is called "Fletd" and by default it's listening on a random TCP port. You can specify a custom TCP port and then open the app in the browser along with desktop view:

```python
flet.app(port=8550, target=main)
```

Open `http://localhost:<port>` in your browser to see web version of your Flet app.
