üòç Happy Valentine Day everyone! üòç

We just released Flet 0.20.0! We follow [Flet roadmap](/roadmap) and this release focuses on:

1) Adaptive UI.
2) Extending Flet apps with 3rd-party Flutter packages.
3) New controls: `Video` (yay!), `AudioRecorder` and a bunch of `Cupertino`-like controls.

## Adaptive UI

TBD

## Integrating existing Flutter packages

TBD

Flet 0.20.0 is a relatively ["large" release](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0200) and could break some things.

Upgrade to Flet 0.20.0, test your apps and let us know what you think by joining [Flet Discord server](https://discord.gg/dzWXP8SHG8) or creating a new thread on [Flet GitHub discussions](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/discussions).

Enjoy!
