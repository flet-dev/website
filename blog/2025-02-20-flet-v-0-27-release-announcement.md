## How to upgrade

Run the following command to upgrade Flet:

```
pip install 'flet[all]' --upgrade
```

:::note
`[all]` is an "extra" specifier which tells pip to install or upgrade all `flet` packages: `flet`, `flet-cli`, `flet-desktop` and `flet-web`.
:::

Bump `flet` package version to `0.27.0` (or remove it at all to use the latest) in your `pyproject.toml`.

## iOS packaging revamped

* 3rd-party Flet app dependencies (aka "site packages", such as "numpy", "pandas", "flet", etc.) are now packed inside a framework into a "bundle" to make XCode sign all files and pass App Store Connect verification.
* Additional `flet build` options to correctly sign iOS packages.
* Extensive step-by-step documentation for packaging and deploying iOS apps. [Check it out!](/docs/publish/ios)

## Enhanced startup performance for desktop apps

Currently, when packaging for macOS, Windows, and Linux, third-party Flet app dependencies (e.g., numpy, pandas, flet, etc.), also known as **site packages**, are bundled inside the app.zip artifact. This can cause a startup delay, sometimes significant, as the app needs to extract the artifact to the userâ€™s file system before launching.

With Flet 0.27.0, site packages are now copied in an **unpacked state** directly into the application bundle instead of being compressed into app.zip. This change significantly reduces the first launch time.

## Faster incremental re-builds

If certain parts of build configuration has not been changed.

## Pyodide 0.27.2

Pyodide 0.27.2 is based on Python 3.12 and has some serious performance improvments to foreign function interface (FFI).

Flet now supports Python 3.12 across all packaging platforms.

The next stop is Python 3.13!

## ðŸ’¥ Breaking changes

`flet build` command:
- `--team` option renamed to `--ios-team-id`.
- `--include-packages` has been removed. Just add extension package into `dependencies` section of your `pyproject.toml` file: https://flet.dev/docs/extend/built-in-extensions
- `--cleanup-on-compile` removed and two new options added to separate cleanup of app and 3rd-party site packages: `--cleanup-app` and `--cleanup-packages`. Two additional options: `--cleanup-app-files` and `--cleanup-package-files` work together with `--cleanup-*` and allow specifying lists of globs to exclude from app and site packages.
- `tool.flet.build_arch` renamed to `tool.flet.target_arch`.
