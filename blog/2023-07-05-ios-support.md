ðŸŽ‰ Whoo-hoo, Flet app is on App Store! ðŸŽ‰

<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/flet/id1624979699" target="_blank"><img src="/img/blog/ios/flet-1080x1080.png" className="screenshot-50 screenshot-rounded"/></a>

Flet iOS app allows you to see how your Flet app written in Python looks and behaves on iPhone or iPad while the app itself is running on your computer.

But it's more than just testing Flet apps on the phone! Flet mobile app itself is written in Python and its publishing to App Store is an important milestone for the entire Flet project, because it's a successful proof that using Flet framework you can create awesome mobile apps in Python and package them so they are accepted in App Store!

**[Follow this guide](/docs/guides/python/testing-on-ios)** to get started with testing your Flet apps on iPhone or iPad. Explore the app, browse Gallery, play with sample projects and app settings.

I must thank [Kivy project](https://kivy.org/) for making a [toolchain for iOS](https://github.com/kivy/kivy-ios) which is used to compile Python interpreter and dependencies for iOS devices. The result is a reusable [serious_python](https://pub.dev/packages/serious_python) Flutter package that can be used to add Python runtime to any Flutter app.
