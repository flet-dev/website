Hello!

Changes:

* Extensibility
* Flutter 3.27
* Installing Flutter, JDK, Android SDK
* Using Flet built with `flet build` in `flet run`.

## How to upgrade

Run the following command to upgrade Flet:

```
pip install 'flet[all]' --upgrade
```

:::note
`[all]` is an "extra" specifier which tells pip to install all `flet` package dependencies. See [New Python packages structure](#new-python-packages-structure) section below for the explanation.
:::

Bump `flet` package version to `0.25.0` (or remove it at all to use the latest) in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.

## Built-in extensions

Flet controls based on 3rd-party Flutter packages that used to be a part of Flet repository, now have been moved to separate repos and published on pypi:

* [flet-ads](https://pypi.org/project/flet-ads/)
* [flet-audio](https://pypi.org/project/flet-audio/)
* [flet-audio-recorder](https://pypi.org/project/flet-audio-recorder/)
* [flet-flashlight](https://pypi.org/project/flet-flashlight/)
* [flet-geolocator](https://pypi.org/project/flet-geolocator/)
* [flet-lottie](https://pypi.org/project/flet-lottie/)
* [flet-map](https://pypi.org/project/flet-map/)
* [flet-permission-handler](https://pypi.org/project/flet-permission-handler/)
* [flet-rive](https://pypi.org/project/flet-rive/)
* [flet-video](https://pypi.org/project/flet-video/)
* [flet-webview](https://pypi.org/project/flet-webview/)

To use a built-in Flet extension in your project, you need to install it first, for example:
```
pip install 'flet[all]' flet-audio
```

## User extensions

Flet now makes it easy to create and build projects with your custom controls based on Flutter widgets or Flutter 3rd-party packages:

1. Create new virtual enviroment and [install Flet](/docs/getting-started/#python-venv-module) there.

2. Create new Flet extension project from template:

```
flet create --template extension --project-name my-project
```

A project with new MyProject control will be created. The control is just a Flutter Text widget with two properties.  

3. Build your app.

Flet project created from extension template has `examples/my_project_example` folder with the example app.

When in the folder where your `pyproject.toml` for the app is, run `flet build` command, for example, for macos:

```
flet build macos -v
```

Open the app and see the new custom Flet Control
```
open build/macos/my-project-example.app
```

4. Run your app.

Once the project was built for desktop once, you can make changes to your python files and run it without re-building.

First, install dependencies from pyproject.toml:
```
pip install .
```

Now, you can make changes to your `main.py`:
```
import flet as ft

from my_project import MyProject


def main(page: ft.Page):
    page.vertical_alignment = ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER
    page.horizontal_alignment = ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER

    page.add(
        ft.Container(
            height=150,
            width=300,
            alignment=ft.alignment.center,
            bgcolor=ft.Colors.PINK_200,
            content=MyProject(
                tooltip="My new pink Control tooltip",
                value="My new pink Flet Control",
            ),
        ),
    )

ft.app(main)
```
 and run your app:
```
flet run
```
