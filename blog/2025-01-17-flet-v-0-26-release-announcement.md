Hello!

Changes:

* Extensibility
* Flutter 3.27
* Installing Flutter, JDK, Android SDK
* Using Flet built with `flet build` in `flet run`.

## How to upgrade

Run the following command to upgrade Flet:

```
pip install 'flet[all]' --upgrade

:::note
`[all]` is an "extra" specifier which tells pip to install all `flet` package dependencies. See [New Python packages structure](#new-python-packages-structure) section below for the explanation.
:::

Bump `flet` package version to `0.25.0` (or remove it at all to use the latest) in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.
