Today, we're releasing **Flet 1.0 Beta**, published as version 0.80.0!

Flet 1.0 is a huge leap forward! Its goal is to ensure long-term growth, with an architecture designed to scale to larger projects, more users, and an expanding feature set.

- Developers can use either imperative or [declarative style](/blog/introducing-declarative-ui-in-flet) to write their Flet apps.
- The new [documentation website](https://docs.flet.dev/) based on mkdocs, generated from Flet code base and always up-to-date.
- End-to-end [integration tests](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/tree/main/sdk/python/packages/flet/integration_tests) for all controls and examples.
- [Extensions](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/tree/main/sdk/python/packages) are back in Flet main repo, with combined docs and covered by tests.
- [Examples](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/tree/main/sdk/python/examples) are back to main Flet repo, always in sync with Flet API and covered by tests.
- [flet debug](https://docs.flet.dev/cli/flet-debug/) CLI for debugging app on real [devices](https://docs.flet.dev/cli/flet-devices/) and [emulators](https://docs.flet.dev/cli/flet-emulators/).
- Build, test and release [workflows](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/actions) are automated with GitHub Actions.
- Clean extensibility model with simplified API on Python and Flutter sides.

## Upgrading to Flet 1.0 Beta

This release differs from the [Alpha](/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha) in that it is no longer a pre-release (there is no `"dev"` suffix) and it **replaces** version **0.28.3** as the current release on PyPI.

This means that if you install `flet` (or any other Flet package), or add it as a dependency **without specifying a version**, you will get **0.80.0** by default.

Why is this important? **0.80.0 is not a drop-in upgrade** — it includes [breaking changes](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/issues/5238). To run an existing app on **0.80.0**, you will need to migrate it manually.

If you use pip to manage your environment just run:

```
pip install 'flet[all]' --upgrade
```

For projects managed by uv you just remove lock file and re-sync:

```
rm uv.lock
uv sync
```

The latest `flet` 0.80.x package version will be installed.

Built-in Flet extensions such as `flet_audio`, `flet_video`, and others are now published with the same version as the core `flet` packages, so be sure to update and pin their dependencies as well.

## Staying on Flet 0.28.x

If you do not plan to upgrade your existing app to Flet 1.0, you will need to pin the Flet version to **0.28.3** in your `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`:

```
flet==0.28.3
```

## Flet app for iOS and Android

:::warning Work in progress
The App Store and Google Play currently host a Flet app built for Flet 0.28.3.
An updated app supporting Flet API 0.80.0 is under development and coming soon.
:::

[Read more about testing on iOS and Android](https://docs.flet.dev/getting-started/testing-on-mobile/).

## Next steps

If you're starting a new app, we recommend using Flet 1.0.

"Beta" means the Flet API is 99% stable and will not change before the 1.0 final release. Flet 1.0 Beta is safe for all new applications.

For Flet 0.28.x (also known as *Flet v0*), we will continue to provide minor updates for bug fixes and security issues, but no new features will be added.

Try Flet 0.80.0 and let us know what you think!

We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! 🎄✨
