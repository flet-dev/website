# Roadmap

## 2026

### Flet 1.0

* **Long-term maintainability:** Controls are implemented using Python **dataclasses**, while the Flutter client adopts the built-in state management approach, eliminating the need for Redux. Ensures symmetric data structures in Python and Dart.
* **Enhanced Developer Experience (DX):** Control documentation is generated directly from source code, preventing discrepancies between docs, comments, and examples. Provides accurate IDE assistance.
* **Optimized Communication:** A binary protocol between Python and Dart eliminates unnecessary base64-to-bytes conversions, reducing CPU overhead and improving memory efficiency.

### Website

* **Ecosystem:** Community gallery for apps, extensions and educational materials (videos, tutorials, talks, etc.).
* FletPad for playground and sharing Flet apps.

### Testing

* End-to-end UI tests for Flet apps.
* Test suite for binary Python packages.

### AI

* MCP server for Flet.

### Community

* Attending [PyCon US 2026](https://us.pycon.org/2026/).

### Packaging

* Flet Packaging and Publishing Service (FPS).
